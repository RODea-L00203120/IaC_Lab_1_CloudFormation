**Setup**: 

    Expanded on this:
     - Set up a Ubuntu VM using virtual box as sand-boxed dev env; 
     - Check IAM user configuration, Git/GitHub credentials.
     - Installed vscode with separate profile for extensions
     - Docker to use AWS Lambda Python image, powertools and boto3 
     - AWS cli tool and SAM local testing environment.
    
**Baseline Tutorial**: Follow basic tutorial - take notes, screenshots during process - refer to AWS documentation regularly - 

    Finished this - looking for something more substantial or will create a folder of useful functions to discuss.

    
**Research** :  Begin writing questions - exploratory research related to best practices, develop plan to go beyond minimum requirements

    Currently navigating through a lot of AWS documentation. To do: tab-groups to references and collate academic references.


## Next Steps: 

Test rino-tutorial template in SAM environment - evaluate functionality and expand. Target one of the following: 

security, scalability, functionality, reliability, maintainability etc. 

Test in SAM environment - screenshot, deploy and screenshot.

Create SAM - set-up tutorial document.
