**Setup**: 

    Expanded on this:
     - Set up a Ubuntu VM using virtual box as sand-boxed dev env; 
     - Check IAM user configuration, Git/GitHub credentials.
     - Installed vscode with separate profile for extensions
     - Docker to use AWS Lambda Python image, powertools and boto3 
     - AWS CLI tool and SAM local testing environment.
    
**Baseline Tutorial**: Follow basic tutorial - take notes, screenshots during process - refer to AWS documentation regularly - 

    Finished this - looking for something more substantial or will create a folder of useful functions to discuss.

    
**Research** :  Begin writing questions - exploratory research related to best practices, develop plan to go beyond minimum requirements

    Currently navigating through a lot of AWS documentation. To do: tab-groups to references and collate academic references.


## Next Steps: 

Having complete the AWS_Powertools_Lambda_Tutorial and the rino_dev tutorial (insert links): 

- Combine the API request feature of the rino dev example with powertools - the build in event handler can achieve a similar function

- Investigate improvements in terms of observability,functionality, reliability, visibility, security etc.
