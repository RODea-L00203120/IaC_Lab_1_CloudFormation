**Setup**: Ensure AWS CLI configuration correct, check IAM user configuration, Git/GitHub credentials.

    Expanded on this; set up a Ubuntu VM using virtual box; installed vscode, created a docker container using AWS Lambda Python image, powertools and boto3; have set up aws cli and local (to vm) testing SAM environment.
    
**Baseline Tutorial**: Follow basic tutorial - take notes, screenshots during process - refer to AWS documentation regularly - 

    Finished this - looking for something more substantial or will create a folder of useful functions to discuss.

    
**Research** :  Begin writing questions - exploratory research related to best practices, develop plan to go beyond minimum requirements

    Currently navigating through a lot of AWS documentation - need to shift to academic papers by Monday. 


## Next Steps: 

Test rino-tutorial template in SAM environment - evaluate functionality and expand. Target one of the following: 

security, scalability, functionality, reliability, maintainability etc. 

Test in SAM environment - screenshot, deploy and screenshot.

Create SAM - set-up tutorial document.
